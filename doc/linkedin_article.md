# Multi-Repository Agentic Programming Skills in 1 Hour: Introducing SwarmPod

The way we build software is changing. AI agents aren't just autocompleting your code anymore — they're managing repositories, coordinating services, and shipping features across entire systems. The problem? Most developers have no idea how to set up the foundation to make this work.

That's why we built SwarmPod.

## What Is SwarmPod?

SwarmPod is an open-source onboarding framework that teaches developers multi-repository agentic programming skills in about an hour. It's built on Ruby on Rails, packaged as a gem, and designed to get you from zero to productive with agentic workflows as fast as possible.

No week-long bootcamps. No 40-hour course. Three focused lessons and you're building.

## The Three Lessons

**Lesson 1: Secrets**
Before you can connect agents to APIs, you need to manage credentials safely. SwarmPod Core handles this with a simple `discover_secret` function that loads API keys from your local filesystem in development and from environment variables in production. Secrets never touch version control.

**Lesson 2: Docker Desktop**
Agents need consistent environments to operate reliably. SwarmPod teaches you to containerize your entire development stack — databases, services, and your Rails app — with a single command. Docker Compose pulls secrets from your local machine and injects them as environment variables inside the container.

**Lesson 3: GitHub**
Multi-repository collaboration is where agentic programming gets real. Pull requests, GitHub Actions, and coordinated workflows across repos keep your team and your agents in sync.

## Everything Else Is Modular

Once you've completed the three core lessons, everything else is pick-and-choose. Additional tools, templates, and extensions are freely available on the CbiPerson GitHub repository. Take what you need, skip what you don't.

## Why This Matters

The barrier to agentic programming isn't intelligence — it's infrastructure. Developers who understand secrets management, containerization, and multi-repo workflows are the ones who can actually put AI agents to work. SwarmPod removes that barrier in an afternoon.

The framework is open source and available now at https://github.com/CbiPerson/swarmpod-core.
